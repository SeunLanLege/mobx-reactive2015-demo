mobservable-reactive2015-demo
=====================

Simple drag & drop editor that uses [mobservable](https://github.com/mweststrate/mobservable) and React.
The slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16hE-cxJ8C5XQVjql17krNAeYNF_9I3n3j13ho-KLWYU/edit#slide=id.p).
The video will follow (hopefully ;-)).

To interact with the application:
* Click to select.
* Boxes can be dragged around.
* Use the input box to rename stuff.
* CTRL + click to add new boxes. If there is an active selection an arrow will be added as well.
* The time travelling buttons are very simple PoC implementation, I'll provide a better implementation soon (a more decent implementation didn't fit into the presentation, see [this thread](https://twitter.com/brianmfitch/status/661873711365103617) for some hints)

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
